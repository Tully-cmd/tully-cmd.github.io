<h1>Detecting and Subverting Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems with NMAP - Tully Martin</h1>
<p>
A computer security specialist should have some general knowledge about the workings of firewalls, Intrusion Detection (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). For the sake of defending computers against threats, an analyst should be aware of firewall rules and the specifics of the firewall rules their systems employ. A penetration tester or a network penetrator will be interested in the inner workings of these network security systems. They will inspect common and default configurations of these security systems to either just simply avoid them, confuse them, or ideally compromise them for further access to the network they are attacking. 
</p>
<p>
In this article I mostly use the term IDS/IPS/firewall interchangeably but there are specific cases where I make the distinction between one. The reason why I do this is because in the modern day of network security, these network defense systems are just morphed into all one thing encompassing intrusion prevention, detection, and misleading attackers through firewall and application layer proxies all in one.  
</p>

When security testing a network by trying to break in, the attacker needs to pick one of the three approaches. Avoiding the IDS/IPS and managing the attack in a matter so that you are undetected. Confusing the network defense system by either spoofing, fragmentation or other means. Exploiting the IDS/IPS or firewall to use as a resource to further compromise the network. Unless you are a reputable expert in the cyber security field you can not count on this last option. Exploiting the network defense system is unreasonable unless in the rare case where there is a machine with a very outdated network protection software, this is becoming even rarer of the case as time goes on but there are still examples. For these reasons this discussion won’t go further into this case of defense system exploitation.
</p>
<p>
Avoiding the IPS/IDS or firewall seems the most straight forward but we often see this is not the case. Novice attackers move in too loudly with common scripts that trigger firewall rules and alert the system, causing the system to put your IP address on a black list or initiating a reverse DNS query to probe the attacker. What are these firewall rules that I keep talking about? Some example default firewall rules for the open source IDS Snort 2.0.0 are as follows; Not allowing ICMP pings of a data size of zero, blocking TCP packets with the URG PSH and FIN flags set (a classic Nmap XMAS scan), and alerting when detecting a Nmap OS detection scan issued by the -O parameter.

To avoid the Intrusion Detection System the penetration tester needs to have patience and slow down. The offensive security tester using Nmap can use timing options and specify it with the -T parameter supplying a number between 0 through 5 or by their name. Using a -T parameter of paranoid (0) or sneaky (1) should be enough, an expert security tester will customize the variables that calculate the timing of these options. These variables include max-parallelism, min-rtt-timeout, and scan-delay. Another option for a network penetrator to evade the IDS and IPS is to fragment their packets with the -f parameter using Nmap. By default you can fragment (split up) the packets into 8 byte segments by specifying the option once, using the -f option again uses 16 byte segments, lastly you can set your own offset using fragmentation using just only the --mtu option that has to be a multiple of eight. It is hard and resource intensive for a network protection system to give meaning to these fragmented packets so many Intrusion Detection Systems do not support fragmentation very well. While doing active investigation on the network in a stealth manner like described above we can hopefully go undetected while trying to identify the firewall to avoid. A common way to detect the firewall is to check the trace route of the packets you are sending to the network. Nmap provides a –traceroute and –packet-trace parameter, but other tools also suffice. You can generate detailed trace routes using either ping, hping, or simply just the traceroute command. A trick is to check the packet ID’s of the packets sequentially, looking for jumps in the ID value instead of the packet ID just incrementing on each transfer then indeed you have a firewall. The attacker can then try to find alternate paths using other hosts in the address space of the network they are trying to hack. To take an alternate path with either strict or loose source routing options, one should do further study on the –ip-options parameter for Nmap.

Misleading the firewall while searching for vulnerable hosts on the network is easier than avoiding and exploitation but still has nuance involved. Fragmentation is also used for confusing the network the same as we discussed but there are many ways to trick the firewall such as MAC address spoofing, and using decoys. Without going into the details for these two parameters –spoof-mac and -d, a network penetrator can use these techniques to disguise the true intention and target of the attack. IDS/IPS are good at detecting decoys. A simple firewall rule such as not allowing more than four connections from different IP addresses that are trying to initiate the same type of scan can make it hard for the attacker to use decoys effectively. Some offensive strategies to go undetected while also taking the advantage of decoys in this specific rule would be to use 3 decoys. The attacker would then be able to successfully trick the network defender by using decoys, but not enough to set off alarms. Another way to confuse the host network defense systems that is worth mentioning, is to scan for hosts in a random order and not sequentially. A large scan on sequential hosts on a single Nmap script would certainly raise some interest your way.

While there are many ways for the conscious penetration tester to gather information about hosts without giving themselves away, there is also easily many more ways modern firewalls/IDS/IPS to come up with rules to counter the common ways attackers like to get in.
